Before project launch, run sql scripts in SqlScripts folder in their numbered order.
Note - database creation may fail depending on local system SQL server express installation path. 

If this is the case, a database named "Consulting" should be created with all default settings. 

The table creation and default data scripts can then be executed along with the application being run.
